We're please to announce that the following specialist tracks have been selected to run in 2021 as part of PyCon AU: 

 * [Education](/education)
 * [Snakeoil Academy](/snakeoil-academy)
 * [DevOops: Learning from Failure](/devoops)
 * [Science, Data, and Analytics](/science-data-and-analytics)

You can learn more about what content these tracks are seeking on their [Track](/tracks) page. 

If you have niche content that falls outside any of these tracks, we still want you to submit for the general conference! 

More information on our call for proposals coming soon!
