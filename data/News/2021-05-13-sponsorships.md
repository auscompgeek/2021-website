G’day everyone!

We’re excited to publish our 2021 sponsorship prospectus, featuring up to date and very online opportunities to connect with attendees and community members at the event.

PyConlineAU (and PyCon AU in person) relies on sponsorship to ensure we can invest in creating a high quality video experience. This includes things like our video production, infrastructure and community platforms.

If your employer, or someone in your network is in a position to sponsor PyConlineAU 2021 we’d love to have a chat about making it a rewarding and impactful experience. Head on over to our [sponsors page](/sponsor/) for more details.

We can’t wait to see your logo on our sponsorships page!
