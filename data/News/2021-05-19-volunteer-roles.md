As we start thinking ahead to our on the day event logistics, PyConline is actively seeking volunteers for the following roles: Green Room Tech Checker, and Show Producer. 

If you are interested in either of these roles, please get in touch at [contact@pycon.org.au](mailto:contact@pycon.org.au)

Please note that these roles are timezone dependent, and require someone who can work within the UTC+10 (Australia/Melbourne) timezone.

### Show Producer

Availability: immediate, through event date.

The Producer ultimately makes sure the show goes on. The Producer ensures that the program selected and scheduled by the Program Chair actually happens!

Extensive support and mentorship will be provided for our show producer. We're asking a producer to be part of our core team early, so that they have experience of the inner workings prior to the conference event/stream.

This role is part of the core organiser team and should be availabile for weekly co-ordination syncs with the core team, and asynchronously by the organiser discord. 

 * Responsible for run-lists, user moderation of backstage.
