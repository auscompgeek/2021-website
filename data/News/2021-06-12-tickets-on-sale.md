We have been overwhelmed by responses to our call for proposals for the second very online PyConline. Our program team will now take the next month to go through the MANY submissions and curate a schedule for our Friday specialist tracks and Saturday general conference. We anticipate everyone who submitted will hear from us about their talk within one month of the CFP close, or **before July 10 2021** (hopefully earlier!)

As we start to squirrel away on curating said program, we want to get you excited about PyConline regardless of the program. With that, we're happy to announce **[tickets are now available](2021.pycon.org.au/attend)!** Our prices remain consistent with last year, with Enthusiast tickets at $29,  Professionals at $79, and Contributors at $300. Students can attend for only $10 upon confirmation of a valid student ID. All prices in AUD including GST.
