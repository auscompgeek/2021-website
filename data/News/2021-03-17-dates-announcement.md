We are pleased to announce that **PyConline AU will be running again on 10 - 12 September 2021 in AEST (UTC+10)**.  Please save the date and reserve your spot on the couch as we're excited to join you once more online, very online, for an online edition of PyCon AU.

After extensive discussion about this years event, we've decided that an online edition offers our community the best opportunity of gathering together comfortably and safely, and without the risk of travel restrictions preventing your participation in the event. We're also mindful that the conference dates have shifted from those initially announced at least year's event - we're hopeful this provides ample notice to adjust to the change.

Furthermore, we're eager to further iterate on the format of our very online event (though we'll have more to announce on this front, soon).

Please also start to consider what topics of interest you might like to speak about, as our Call for Proposals (CFP) will open in April. Details on how to submit will be forthcoming very soon, but you can expect a date in April.

We are *also* currently seeking interest for **Specialist Tracks** and **Volunteer Organisers,** so keep reading below.

### Specialist Tracks

We're opening our call for Specialist Track organisers for PyConline AU this year. Details have been updated on the [specialist tracks page](/tracks), and we're asking for specialist track nominations to be emailed to the conference team by **31 March 2021**.

### Volunteer organisers

We are currently seeking volunteers who would like to work with us behind the scenes leading up to the event. Our core team would enthusiastically welcome volunteers in the following positions/roles: 

- **Sponsorships Lead**: Liaise closely with our sponsors (and find new ones) throughout the event.
- **Program Chair**: You'll be the shepherd of the "Call for Proposals" process, coordinating reviewers and review processes to pull together our conference schedule.
- **Production Lead**: Help 'call the show' and liaise closely between conference and video streaming teams on-the-day (including lead up communications and planning).

The core organising team is eager to share their prior experience in these roles to support new people to join the team, so prior PyCon AU experience is not necessary.

Please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact@pycon.org.au?subject=PyCon AU 2021 Volunteer interest - POSITION" target=_blank>contact@pycon.org.au</a> if you are interested in any of the above positions.

Our call for volunteers for event logistics-specific roles (session chairs, etc) will happen closer to the event.
