# Program

Our call for papers closed on June 10 2021, AoE

We are currently sorting through the MANY proposals we received, and hope to inform all speakers by July 11 2021 or earlier. 

Expect our program to be published soon after. 

Our program consists of two major sections: Friday, our [specialist tracks](/tracks), and Saturday, our general program. Our Sunday will be dedicated to [social events](/social/).
