# Technical requirements for presenting live

- You'll need a webcam and microphone. If you have a webcam built into your laptop it might be fine, but it's a good idea to plug in an external microphone if at all possible&mdash;you'll find more detail on our AV tips page linked below.
- You'll need a stable Internet connection. If you know youâ€™ve got Internet issues (i.e. you usually have issues with video conferencing with work colleagues, your wifi drops out a lot, etc), please consider pre-recording instead.
- You'll need a secondary monitor plugged into your computer, **or** a secondary device (such as a spare laptop, phone or tablet, but make sure it's set not to go to sleep!) to display the chat / stream return feed separate to your screen sharing screen.  This is so we can communicate with you during your talk (if there is a problem, or reminders about time).
- You'll need the latest **Chrome** or **Firefox**. It's also a good idea to have **Skype** or **Zoom** installed, as we can fall back to these as a backup.
