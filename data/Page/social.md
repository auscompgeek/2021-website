# Social Events

With the lockdowns in many parts of Australia and New Zealand, we are an extremely online event. Excessively so.

Since we can't have viewing parties, let's ramp up the social with extremely online social events!

We have had many people offering to run many things. Details about capacity, access, etc, will be available closer to the event. 

## Friday evening

### Online Karaoke

Bring your absolutely best voice and a microphone and let’s sing away our hearts!


### Dinner-side chat about machine learning 

Wanna chat about machine learning while enjoying your dinner? Say no more. 

## Saturday evening

### Dinner with PyFriends

All attendees, speakers, volunteers and organisers welcomed to our virtual dinner party! Sure, bring your kids, your dogs, cats and pet kangaroos. 

## Sunday

### Lightning talks ⚡️

Yes, they are back this year! Submissions will happen on Saturday, so make sure to submit your ideas! 

### RPG one-shots

Two sessions will be available on Sunday, each one for 6 people and lasting around 3.5h. Expression of interest will be available by Friday, and participants selected by Saturday. 

### Family-friendly karaoke

Got some kids to entertain at home? Fear no more. Yes, we will sing Let It Go until the neighbours complain. 

### MarioKart and Mario Party

Of course, Mario is back. 

### 0 A.D. ([game site](https://play0ad.com/))

Ancient warfare is your thing? Buckle up then!

## More social!

If you are keen on hosting online games, there will be plenty of opportunities during breaks or on Sunday. Instructions will be available the week before the conference. 

Do you have anything you’d be interested in hosting that isn’t listed here? Get in contact with us [via email](mailto:contact@pycon.org.au), and we can try to get it on our program.
