description: <p>The Python Package Index has taken massive strides as a service since
  its inception in 2002. Through committed volunteer action, two major grants, and
  a bevy of generous hosting providers this service has long established itself as
  a mission critical piece of infrastructure for nearly every Python developer globally.
  This keynote will take some time in retrospect of the growth, trials, tribulations,
  and successes of PyPI in the last twenty years. It will also raise to the surface
  the potential concerns for the sustainability PyPI and some of the ways that the
  Python Software Foundation believes PyPI can continue to reliably serve the Python
  community for the next twenty years.</p>
