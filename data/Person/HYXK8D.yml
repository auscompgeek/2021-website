name: Amanda J Hogan
pronouns: She/her
bio: <p>Amanda is a teacher at a co-educational secondary school in Sydney. She's
  been trying to find really effective and engaging ways to teach students how to
  solve problems with code for some time now with mixed success. She is a contributor,
  content creator and tutor for the Sydney branch of the Girls Programming Network.
  She is the current treasurer of the ICT Educators professional association in NSW
  and in that role tries hard to mentor new teachers or teachers new to computing.
  She always has some project on the go from e-textiles to making web tools to make
  her life easier. In a former life she was a database and web developer. In her opinion
  Python is the best mix of power and ease of use for beginner programmers. In her
  spare time she throws herself at bouldering walls or rides her bike.</p>
