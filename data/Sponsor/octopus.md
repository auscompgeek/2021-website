**Help us make a big green dent in the universe.** We're on a mission to drive the global renewable energy revolution, and we need loads more people to help us make our vision a reality.

Octopus Energy Group is an energy tech company. We use technology to make green electrons cheap and revolutionise customer experiences.  

Kraken is our revolutionary energy tech platform, built around the customer.

Kraken promotes a culture of customer centricity, grounded on delivering simple processes and straightforward interactions. Built around a scalable, cloud-based architecture running continuous deployments, Krakenâ€™s ability to help teams innovate and accelerate is second-to-none.

As well as all that, Octopus Energy for Business supplies green energy to over 20,000 companies, Octopus Electric Vehicles helps make clean transport cheaper and easier, Octopus Energy Services brings smart products into thousands of homes, and Octopus Centre for Net Zero is a multi-disciplinary research organisation helping Governments and industry reach net zero sooner. 

Engineering standards are high. We pair program, thoroughly review and test code before it deploys, and maintain fast, high-value test suites. We have weekly tech talks, monthly blitz-days (eg sharpening our internal tools, upgrading dependencies) and can often be found at tech meet-ups and conferences.

Our [coding conventions are open-source](https://github.com/octoenergy/styleguide) and we maintain a [tech blog](https://tech.octopus.energy/).

Octopus is a great place to learn, work with some talented engineers and level-up your skills. We are providing a great opportunity to help shape the development of Australian market specific functionality into our global energy platform.
